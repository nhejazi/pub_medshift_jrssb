* To reproduce the simulation study reported in the manuscript, examine the
  `simulation` subdirectory and the directions in the `README.md` file therein.
* To reproduce the data analysis results reported in the manuscript, examine the
  `application` subdirectory and the code it contains.

_N.B._, that both directories contain scripts to install the [appropriate
version of our `medshift`
package](https://github.com/nhejazi/medshift/releases/tag/jrssb) for the
simulation studies and empirical illustration of the methodology.

Should any concerns arise, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/nhejazi/pub_medshift_jrssb/issues/new) with a clear
description of the problem encountered.
